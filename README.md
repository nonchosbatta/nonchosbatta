The goal
--------
The goal of nonchosbatta is creating an environment where you can find all the series your favorite fansubs are translating and being updated of the current status of each episode and so on.

Technical details [here](https://gist.github.com/RoxasShadow/5c1a5ad492920c0865aa) (it'll change damn frequently tho).

The name
--------
nonchosbatta was historically meant as a whole project including [pigro](https://github.com/nonchosbatta/pigro) as main server, [mescalina](https://github.com/nonchosbatta/mescalina) as frontend and [assonnato](https://github.com/nonchosbatta/assonnato) as RESTful wrapper gem for pigro's APIs.

Fansub...?
----------
[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub).
Consider also that nonchosbatta is born for anime shows, but the goal is to keep it suitable for TV series too.
